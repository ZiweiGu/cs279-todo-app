# cs279-todo-app

In the terminal, run the following command to open the web app using a local host:
```
python3 app.py
```

The todo-app uses python and Flask, following a Model-View-Controller structure. 
The html file is in the "templates" folder and all the python code is in the 
app.py script. A Sqlite database, which is initialized upon starting the page,
 is used to keep track of todo items.
